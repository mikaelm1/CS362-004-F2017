1. A bug was found when testing the smithy card effect. The unit tests that were run against the smithy card effect function failed because the player's hand had one card more than the player was supposed to have. Also, the deck count is wrong, it has one less than expected. The error is a bug in the smithy_card() function where it allows the player to draw four cards instead of the correct three.

2. A bug was found when testing the adventurer card effect. The unit tests revealed that the player's hand count increased by one more than it should have. The error is caused by a bug in the adventurer_card() function, which continously draws cards from the deck until the player has three treasure cards, but the correct version should stop drawing cards once the player has two treasure cards.

3. A bug was found when testing the feast card effect. The unit tests revealed that when attempting to purchase a Village card after gaining coins from the feast card, the code failed to purchase the Village card. The error is caused by a bug in the feast_card() function where it calls gainCard() and passes in an invalid flag, which instead of adding the card to the player's hand, puts the card into the discard pile.
